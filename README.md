# Superstore Looker Dashboard

## Overview

Having recently left my role as a Senior Data Analyst at Feefo I was given permission to use our Looker instance to create a portfolio dashboard project. Having used the Superstore dataset when learning Tableau I decided it would be a great time to revisit it.

The scope of this project is very limited due to the time constraint before losing access to the Looker instance. 

To allow for a quick build the main purpose of this dashboard is to communicate my ability to model view, explores and then buidl the visualisations for the dashboard. For speed I have created a 'combined' dimension table, which although not correctly normalised allows me to demonstarte the joins between views.

I would normally ideate the build around a user persona. These would focus on the value to the end user and normally center around a strategic, operational, analytical or tactical design approach. In this instance, again, I have not had time. The visuals are a fairly random mix therefore, chosen to prove my skills as a technical developer and not from a product perspective. 

Testing has been non-existant due tot he rush so I'm confident beyond the nice visuals there will be errors that need correcting.
