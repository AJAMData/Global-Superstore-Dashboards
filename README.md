# Superstore Dataset Looker (Not Studio) Dashboard


## Overview

Having recently left my role as a Senior Data Analyst at Feefo I was given permission to use our Looker instance to create a portfolio dashboard project. Having used the Superstore dataset when learning Tableau I decided to revisit it.

The scope of this project is very limited due to the time constraint before losing access to the Looker instance. 

To allow for a quick build the main purpose of this dashboard is to communicate my ability to utilise views, explores and Looks for the dashboard. For speed I have created a 'combined' dimension table, which although not correctly normalised allows me to demonstrate my ability to join views in the model. 

I would normally ideate the build around a user persona. This would focus on the value to the end user and normally center around a strategic, operational, analytical or tactical design approach. In this instance, again, I have not had time. The visuals are a fairly random mix, chosen to display my skills as a technical developer and not designed from a product perspective. 

Testing has been non-existant due to the rush so I'm confident beyond the nice visuals there will be errors that need correcting.
